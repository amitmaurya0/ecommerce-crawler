I've used lots of different brands over the years, and I have to say, these ones work the best so far. I imagine that has to do with the quality of the ingredients for which you have to pay a little more. But like everything in life, you get what you pay for."

        "review_data": "I thought I reviewed this already. in fact, the only reason I am doing so now is because I have just sent the link to a friend who's son has issues with his digestion. I've had colitis for 6 years now, and this probably changed my life. I started constantly flaring a couple of years ago and lost over a stone and nothing I was doing was working. The meds stopped working and all the dietary changes I made had little to no effect.  I had read a few people saying that fibre had helped them, but I always under the impression that fibre is for people who have constipation, not issues with urgency and frequency that affect those with ibd or severe ibs. Then I watched a programme about the effects of fibre on the digestive system. Fibre it seems normalises the body functions, so it softens hard poo for those with constipation (which a lot of reviewers on here seem to attest to) But in addition, it also adds bulk the stool which slows down the speed which digestion takes place for those with ibd and ibs. For me after a week I noticed a difference and after a month a significant improvement which allowed my medication to resume working, and meant that I went virtually back to normal bowel habits. I also recommended this to another friend that had a different issue, which has meant they have been in and out of hospital and they have gone from a frequency of 8 times a day to 3, which is a lot better for them. I have heard people say Oh this doesn't work for me I've tried aloe vera ect not willing to give this a go. This isn't aloe vera. My body had a bad reaction that too. This is a soluble fibre, which is why it's great even as a supplement for ibs and ibd sufferers as some insoluble fibre can cause issues. Please give it a go for a week. It might just give you your life back."

        "review_data": "- I find these very easy to take - compared to the powder, which I used to put in smoothies, blurg, thick and goopy...- At first I kept forgetting to take BETWEEN meals (not with, as they may block absorption of vitamins if taken with food), now I try to time taking one a chill out/coffee/cuppa breaks and no food.- I take one pill between breakfast and lunch (with a cuppa) and the same between lunch and dinner.  They are medium size, but easy to swallow veggie friendly gelatine free capsules.  No smell or taste, that repeats, so that is very good!  In combo with taking a probiotics before breakfast, this is great during periods of stress and irregular eating, just to keep your system balanced and healthy, and I am finding I feel clear headed and a bit more energised.  I think as part as an overall healthy lifestyle, these are really handy when I know I'm travelling a lot/eating out a lot - so I won't be getting in my green smoothies or be too rushed to cook as much veg - a quick fibre blast to keep the system happy.- HUGE bottle, 200 pills - lasting ages for a decent price.  Not the cheapest in the world, but I want reliable quality/a brand I trust -  Solgar have been good for everything I have tried - I also like their fish oil (incredibly high strength).- The dark glass is great for preserving quality, and I just jiffy bag a handful when travelling, in my handbag."

Every morning I take 2 capsules out and put them into a cereal bowl without the capsules.  Then I add some oat bran and wheat bran (both in a ground-down form rather than in a stick form) and some warm water and mix them well with a spoon.  Some milk can be added.  I have continued this for 10 weeks and my constipation has been improved.  On top of this, my feet and hands are now very warm and my body feels generally warmer than before.  As I have always suffered from coldness, I feel now revitalised.  Maybe is this the result of developing a good \u201cintestinal flora\u201d???"

It works just as well as Lepicol and if I'm starting to feel a bit *bunged up*, I take four capsules with a generous drink of squash and a few hours/ day later, I have a good healthy no.2 in the bathroom.I initially started taking psyllium husk in early 2017 because I was very constipated for 2.5 weeks and nothing I had tried worked. OTC and GP prescribed medicines didn't help relieve my constipation, but after trying pysillium husk, it got me moving again.  Amazing stuff, it's my go-to supplement for healthy guts and bowel movements and as a bonus, it's cured me of my IBS-D which was a nightmare itself.10/10"

        "review_data": "Definitely feel and see a difference from these capsules. Have bought again And will continue to do so. Helps with a host of ailments and issues that arise from the gut - whether you know them too or not - in the works of Hippocrates: 'All disease begins in the gut.'Before trying the Solgar PH capsules I was using fiber flakes/ power form and found this sometimes a handful to swallow, as it would absorb water in any drink making it very thick and hard to drink. I've always had regular bowel movements but after taking PH on a daily basis I noticed that bowel movements were much easier to pass and ha da somewhat less offensive smell shall we say. Not sure if I have IBS or what but I definitely get bloated from eating the wrong things and just generally when my diet is poor. I also get stomach upsets and gas. PH helps with all of that. I suspected last year that I may have candida or definitely somekind of yeast overgrowth, after doing extensive research on some random conditions I've been plagued with for years that my GP/ prescribed and over counter meds couldn't treat. I was looking for a natural, even holistic or Ayurvedic alternative to modern synthetic drugs that I'd recently discovered are all neurotoxins of some sort... Anyway, I suffered from yeast infections on and off for years, nothing I took or did could stop it. In my mid teens I also developed an excessively dry bottom lip that constantly peeled and chapped no matter what. After about 15 years, and through no help of the many GPs I'd consulted about my lip over the years, I eventually discovered the condition had a name, exfoliative cheilitis, and while i felt helpless to the fact that my lip constantly dried up and peeled off, at least I could cover the discoloured, sore, broken, bleeding skin under lipstick most of the time... needless to say that didn't help with the healing process, it was a viscous circle. I could never find much about causes for exfoliative cheilitis on the net, other than doctors the world over stating it a rare condition, and unsure of causes and cure... BUt then last year I came across a forum or a Pintrest article or something that indicated it was due to candida/ bacteria overgrowth and/or a problem in the lower insetting i.e. Gut. And images of Chinese medicine face mapping - how skin issues e.g. Spots, peeling, eczema on certain parts of the face are a sign of a problem with a organ in the body...I wasn't taking PH for candida but at some point I noticed my lips stopped drying up and peeling so it wasn't long before I turned to google to confirm that PH can help treat candida by cleaning up th gut somewhat. I have some small fibroaids and I've noticed an improvement in the way they feel, pain and size since taking PH. I used to talk the husk fibre in the daytime, normally in a breakfast smoothie but then I read somewhere that nighttime is best as PH can help you sleep. Since then I've been taking the capsules in the evening and haven't looked back.Long and short of it is. Do your reasearch - PH is great for so many things and it's natural. And if you have IBS, yeast, metabolic and skin issues you should definitely think about a colon cleanse e.g psyllium husk!"

I have tried all prescription meds and more natural meds than I care to count...nothing has worked or has sometimes made it worse.Recently I had a bad flare up going 10-20 x a day for over 3 weeks I lost over a stone in weight and was at a very low point. I took one of these capsules an hour before food and on the very first day I took it I only went once and that was a normal consistency not watery like the previous 3 weeks....I was amazed I have been taking it for just over a week now and am going to the toilet every 2 to 3 days, I don't feel constipated or bloated so don't mind that. My stomach cramps and pains have also  decreased quite a lot some days none at all. I have tried this with foods that are not trigger foods but some that can occasionally effect me and I have been fine. It has also coped with a very stressful few days back at work.Theses amazing results may not last but even so I would still recommend trying it especially if your having a flare up.I cannot state enough how much this has changed my life...I can now leave the house and even went back to the gym.Please give it a go"

The doctor stated she had never seen a cholesterol turn around so quickly. I cannot attribute these tablets solely to this but as it was part of my new routine (1 a day) I intend to carry on. I was fit and active before the first doctor visit, however, my diet was very poor \u2013 High sat fats, no salad, no fish etc.Works as intended, helped lower my bad cholesterol and raise my good one \u2013 potentially a lifesaver. Easy to swallow without horrible flavours, no negative side effects noted."
